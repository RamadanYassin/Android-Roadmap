  - **Why**: Build a professional online presence and clarify career goals for internship applications.
  - **Duration**: ~6 hours
  - **Practice**: Update LinkedIn with your Capstone project and apply to 5–10 Android internships.

**Total Duration**: ~49–51 hours (3–4 weeks at 15 hours/week)

**Milestone**: Build functional apps with MVVM, Room, Retrofit, and coroutines. Your portfolio includes the Capstone project, and you’ve started applying for internships.

## Advanced
**Goal**: Master advanced architecture and dependency injection to build production-ready apps.

- **MVI**
  - **Resource**: [Modern Android App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-architecture) (Google)
  - **Why**: Learn MVI and scalable architecture practices.
  - **Duration**: ~10 hours

## Tips
- **Stick to the Sequence**: Follow the order above to avoid redundant resources (e.g., skip Udacity’s Jetpack Compose course, as Google’s covers it).
- **Build Projects**: Complete the Capstone and Now in Android projects, plus one personal app (e.g., to-do or movie list) for your portfolio.
- **Set Deadlines**: Finish each stage in 2–4 weeks (total: ~9–10 weeks at 15 hours/week).
- **Limit Passive Learning**: Spend ~50% of time coding or on career prep, not just watching videos.
- **Learn Git Early**: Use a quick Git tutorial (~2 hours) to manage projects from the Basic stage.
- **Engage with Communities**: Join r/androiddev (Reddit) or #AndroidDev (X) for support.
- **UI/UX Basics**: Learn basic wireframing (e.g., Figma, ~3 hours) for the Capstone if needed.

**Total Duration**: ~138–145 hours (9–10 weeks at 15 hours/week)
