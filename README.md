### Why This Order?

- **Foundational Skills First**: Start with Kotlin (1) and basic Android development (2), then learn modern UI with Jetpack Compose (3).
- **Hands-On Practice**: The Capstone Project (4) reinforces your skills through application.
- **Advanced Topics**: Courses 5–8 build on your foundation, covering complex concepts and techniques used in professional apps.
- **Real-World Application**: The Now in Android project (9) ties everything together with a practical, industry-standard example.
- **Career Readiness**: The final steps (10–14) focus on presenting your skills to employers, culminating in interview preparation.

This sequence ensures a logical progression, allowing you to build confidence and competence step by step while preparing you for a career in Android development. You can optionally start updating your GitHub and LinkedIn profiles earlier (e.g., after the Capstone Project) as you complete projects, but the listed order keeps the focus on technical mastery first, followed by career preparation.
